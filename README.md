# 🚀 Gen AI Learning & Project Repository

Welcome to my personal roadmap and project workspace for mastering Generative AI, MLOps, Deep Learning, and modern AI engineering practices.  
This repository is organized into modular folders covering core technical domains and hands-on learning tracks.

Each folder contains structured notes, source code, and projects for applied learning.
